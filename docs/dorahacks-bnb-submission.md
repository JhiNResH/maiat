# Maiat — BNB Good Vibes (DoraHacks) Submission

## Project Name
Maiat

## One-liner
On-chain verified reviews for crypto — trust scores for DeFi protocols and AI agents on BNB Chain.

## Description

Maiat brings verified reviews to BNB Chain. Users prove on-chain usage before reviewing — no fake reviews, no shilling.

**BNB Chain Integration:**
- **ReviewRegistry contract** deployed on BSC testnet (`0x9453A6EA1BB1Acd31F2288971DBda8e4088EFF37`)
- **BscScan verification** — validates user transactions on BSC before allowing reviews
- **PancakeSwap** included as featured BNB Chain protocol with trust scoring

**Key Features:**
- On-chain usage proof verification (Ethereum + Base + BSC)
- AI baseline + community-weighted trust scores
- Auto-discovery via CoinGecko — any project queryable
- Public API for AI agents (Virtuals ACP integration)
- Telegram real-time alerts (@maiatalerts)

**Smart Contract:**
ReviewRegistry on BSC anchors review hashes on-chain, creating an immutable record of verified reviews.
